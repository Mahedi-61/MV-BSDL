## 🍀 Overview
### Project Title: Deep Bangla Sign Language Recognition from Video: A New Large-scale Dataset
#### Contributor: Md Shamimul Islam, A.J.M. Akhtarujjaman Joha, Md Nur Hossain, Sohaib Abdullah, Md Mahedi Hasan
#### Description : 

The absence of an extensive Bangla sign language video dataset presents a significant challenge for Bangla Sign Language Recognition (BSLR). To tackle this issue, our project introduces the first multi-view, large-scale video dataset in Bangla sign language, MV-BSLD. This dataset aims to facilitate the development of deep learning-based algorithms for BSLR by encompassing 4,000 high-resolution sign videos.

The MV-BSLD dataset is meticulously curated, featuring a selection of 50 isolated words across 13 different categories, focusing on both general vocabulary and emergency-related terms. Signers wore clothes of various colors and performed the signs while seated. These videos were recorded at 30 frames per second, capturing three camera angles—front, left side, and right side—against a green background

In this study, we **manually capture** the Multi-View Bangla Sign Language Dataset. We have the following variations on our dataset:
* Words (50) 
* Views (front 👆, left👈, right👉)
* Time (day, night)
* Dress (different colors)
* Camera (DSLR, smartphone)
